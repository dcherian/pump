\begin{abstract}
The equatorial Pacific cold tongue is a site of large heat uptake by the ocean.
This heat uptake is enabled by a daily cycle of turbulence (deep-cycle turbulence) beneath the mixed layer that acts to remove heat from the sea surface and deposit it near the core of the Equatorial Undercurrent.
Deep-cycle turbulence results when turbulence is triggered daily in sheared and stratified mean flow that is marginally stable (gradient Richardson number $\Ri \approx 0.25$).
Deep-cycle turbulence has been observed on numerous occasions in the cold tongue at 0°N, 140°W and is known to be modulated by Tropical Instability Waves.

Here we use a primitive equation regional simulation of the cold tongue to show that the cold cusps of Tropical Instability Waves are a site of marignally stable flow and consequently, deep-cycle turbulence.
In particular, deep-cycle turbulence is seen at latitudes between 3°N and 5°N in the eastward extension of the TIW cold cusp for more than a week during a TIW period.
The simulated off-equatorial deep cycle is forced by meridional shear $v_z$ that results from the horizontal vortex tilting of zonal shear $u_z$  generated by horizontal vortex stretching near the equator.
The simulated diurnal trigger is the daily descent of the surface mixing layer associated with the weakening of the stabilizing surface buoyancy flux in the afternoon.
Observational evidence for the off-equatorial deep cycle is lacking with the exception of a few CTD casts, which when combined with shear from shipboard ADCP data suggest the presence of $\Ri\approx 0.25$ and marginally stable flow in the cold cusp.

Here are some things that I feel are weak / need addressing.
1. Figure 1d shows heat flux below /mixed/ layer, not KPP boundary layer. So this may be an incorrect too-high value; high because we get quite high heat fluxes when KPPhbl = monin-obukhov length > MLD for 1-2 hours a day (Section 3.2.2).

# 2. Flow streamlines are probably quite innacurate near the equator (Figure 5). Equatorial disturbances travel westward at 0.8m/s and disturbances north of 2°N / 3°N travel at 0.3m/s in cite:Kennan2000. I think the streamlines need to be more closed north of 2°N in general, based on what I've read, but who knows what this particular TIW would look like. Not sure there is a good way to address this without actually advecting particles.

* Introduction

The equatorial Pacific cold tongue is a zonal band of cold upper-ocean water in the eastern equatorial Pacific extending between the Pacific's eastern margin and approximately 155°W.
Being cold water in a region of large solar insolation, the cold tongue is a region of large heat uptake by the ocean between approximately 3°S and 3°N (for example citealp:Large2009,Holmes2019).
Such heat uptake is only possible if the heat taken in by the ocean is quickly transported away from the equatorial sea surface.
Hence the equatorial region remains cool enabling further heat uptake.
Mixed layer budgets for the eastern Pacific using equatorial moorings show that the downward transport of heat by microscale turbulence is essential to keeping the sea surface cool citep:Moum2013,Wang1999,Wang2000a,Warner2019,Ray2018.
Meridional advection at submonthly timescales then transports that heat poleward citep:Ray2018.
The annual cycle of turbulence is strong enough that there is only a single peak in the annual cycle of equatorial sea surface temperature (SST) despite a double peak in solar insolation as the sun "crosses" the equator twice through the year citep:Moum2013.
On longer timescales, the rate of change of SST during ENSO phase transitions is seen to approximately agree with both amplitude and phase of turbulence heat flux divergence across the mixed layer citep:Warner2019.
Equatorial mixing might be critical to one of the Earth's most consequential climate phenomena.

There have been numerous observational campaigns aimed at quantifying equatorial turbulence through microstructure measurements, though these experiments do not capture all the temporal and spatial scales of flow variability.
# The measurements support the idea that dissipation is crucial to the equatorial flow regime: time-limited measurements show rate of turbulent dissipation to be similar in magnitude to surface fluxes of both momentum and heat citep:Crawford1981,Moum1985,Gregg1985,Peters1994.
At the equator, winds maintain a strong zonal mean flow with intense vertical shear between the eastward flowing Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) at depth and the westward flowing near-surface South Equatorial Current (SEC).
Observations at 0°N, 140°W repeatedly show the existence of a deep-reaching daily cycle of shear-driven turbulence  — the "deep cycle of turbulence" — in the high shear zone above the core of the EUC but beneath the base of the mixed layer citep:Gregg1985,Moum1985,Lien1995,Moum2009b.
Here the flow's gradient Richardson number $\Ri = b_z/(u_z² + v_z²) ≈ 0.25$ throughout the year i.e. this layer is marginally stable to shear instability citep:Thorpe2009,Smyth2013,Pham2017,Smyth2019.
Buoyancy $b=-gρ/ρ_0$, $(u,v)$ are the horizontal components of velocity and subscripts indicate differentiation.
#+latex:{\alert
A daily cycle of turbulence requires that turbulence be triggered in the marginally stable layer daily. 
At least two hypotheses have been proposed for this diurnal trigger.
A number of authors (e.g. citealp:Wijesekera1991,Peters1994) propose that downward-propagating internal waves, excited at the base of the mixed layer during nighttime convection, break in the marginally stable layer and trigger turbulence.
More recently, citep:Pham2017 propose that the diurnal trigger is the instability of the diurnal warm-layer jet formed by the trapping of momentum in a near-surface stratified layer.
#+latex:}
As the near-surface stratification built up by solar radiation during the day decreases in the afternoon and the warm-layer jet goes unstable, triggering turbulence at the base of the mixed layer citep:Pham2017.
This turbulence transports momentum downward, locally increasing shear in the marginally stable layer, reducing $\Ri$ and triggering further shear instability.
As this process continues, the envelope of actively turbulent fluid propagates downward and is visible as a downward descent of a local maximum in vertical shear citep:Smyth2013b.
Turbulence persists during the next morning at depths up to 80-100m at 0°N, 140°W despite the cessation of near-surface convection.
#+latex: {\alert
cite:Smyth2019 argues that turbulent diffusion tends to reduce buoyancy and velocity gradients, $b_z$ and $u_z$, at roughly similar rates, thereby increasing $\Ri=b_z/u_z^2$ back to its marginally stable value of approximately 0.25.
Large eddy simulations initialized with mean fields representative of each of the four seasons show that the deep cycle exists throughout the year, though the depth to which it penetrates varies with the seasonal shoaling and deepening of the EUC citep:Pham2017.

Deep-cycle turbulence is not limited to the Pacific.
cite:Wenegrat2015 describe moored observations of diurnal cycling of shear and stratification in the equatorial Atlantic that suggests the presence of deep-cycle turbulence.
Further, cite:Pei2020 present a primitive equation simulation using the $k-ε$ turbulence closure model that simulates a state of marginal stability and deep cycle turbulence in the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Ocean basins.
To our knowledge, deep-cycle turbulence in the Atlantic and Indian Ocean basins has not been recorded in microstructure observations so far.

The equatorial current system is unstable to both barotropic and barolinic instability; these instabilities give rise to Tropical Instability Waves (TIWs; citealp:Lyman2005,Philander1976).
TIWs have zonal wavelengths of \SIrange{1000}{2000}{\km}, periods of \SIrange{15}{40}{days} and propagate westward with a phase speed of approximately \SI{0.5}{\m\per\s} citep:Qiao1995.
There are two modes of variability: 17-day fluctuations between 2°S and 2°N and a 33 day fluctuation north of 2°N citep:Lyman2007.
# - TIWs result from resonance between free equatorial Rossby waves citep:Lyman2005.
At finite amplitude, they are prominently visible in SST as narrow cold salty crests or cusps followed by a broad region of warmer fresher water citep:Legeckis1977,Chelton2000,Lee2012.
The narrow cusps are associated with strong convergence, high chlorophyll concentrations and narrow peaks in fluorescence citep:Strutton2001,Yoder1994.
The warm troughs are characterized by strong anticyclonic relative vorticity north of the equator and are often termed Tropical Instability Vortices (TIVs).
TIVs are not perfectly coherent structures but are instead quite leaky citep:Dutrieux2008,Holmes2014.
The anticyclonic circulation in the warm trough wraps the cold cusp around redirecting it eastward at its northernmost extent ("eastward extension").
TIWs energize submesoscale motions in high resolution models citep:Holmes2014,Marchesiello2011 and have been observed to generate extremely sharp fronts citep:Warner2018.
TIWs exhibit both seasonality (most energetic between July and February) and interannual variability (active during La Niña and ENSO-neutral conditions).

TIWs have been observed to modulate cold tongue turbulence.
cite:Lien2008 reported intense mixing at the base of the mixed layer recorded by a Lagrangian float that meandered through two TIWs between 2°S and 1°N in 2005 with a peak heat flux estimate of \SI{1000}{\W\per\square\m}.
During the EQUIX experiment at (0, 140°W) in 2008, a La Nina year, TIWs significantly increased turbulence heat fluxes at the equator to approximately \SI{400}{\W\per\square\m} when averaged over two weeks citep:Moum2009b compared to the approximately \SI{50}{\W\per\square\meter} measured previously citep:Lien1995.
These observations agree with modeling studies that show enhanced turbulence both at the equator as well as in the TIW cold cusp off the equator citep:Menkes2006,Holmes2015.
cite:Holmes2015 proposed a dynamical explanation for the enhancement of equatorial turbulence by TIWs: meridional diffluence (positive $v_y$) of TIW flow at the equator during the cold phase stretches the southward-oriented meridional component of horizontal vorticity ($ω^y = w_x - u_z$).
The stretching increases $\abs{ω^y}$, intensifies the pre-existing $u_z$ at the equator, and forces intense turbulence.
During the warm phase, the reverse happens: vortex tubes are squashed and $u_z$ weakens with a corresponding weakening of turbulence.
Observational evidence for this mechanism is inconclusive citep:Inoue2019.
However TIWs do appear to modulate deep-cycle turbulence at the equator.
For example the base of the marginally stable layer appeared to shallow by a factor of two to \SI{50}{m} during the warm phase of the TIW as compared to that during the cold phase citep:Moum2009b,Inoue2012,Inoue2019.
Mixing was stronger during the "cold phase" (the cold cusp) and weaker during the following "warm phase".
Note that previous microstructure profiler observations have not yet captured one entire TIW period.
#+latex: {\alert
Recent work with TAO observations indicates that a subsurface mode of TIWs citep:Liu2019a as well as equatorial inertial gravity waves at periods between 3 and 25 days citep:Liu2020 may strongly influence the vertical structure of shear and thereby diapycnal mixing at the equator, consistent with cite:Moum2009b.

TIWs also change the latitudinal scale of equatorial mixing: the simulations of both cite:Menkes2006 and cite:Holmes2015 show the presence of intense mixing in TIW cold cusps off the equator.
But, most equatorial microstructure measurements have been made right at the equator, primarily at 0°, 140°W in the Pacific.
This sampling bias means that large unknowns remain in our knowledge of the longitudinal and latitudinal extents, as well as the spatial scales of variability of equatorial upper-ocean mixing.
#+latex:}

# Meridional transects with microstructure observations suggest that turbulence peaks at the equator citep:Hebert1991 above the undercurrent (also see citealp:Crawford1981,Carr1996,Moum1986a).

Here we use a 1/20° regional model of the cold tongue to study how TIWs modulate turbulence off the equator.
The simulated TIWs force off-equatorial deep-cycle turbulence by generating intense shear ($v_z$) in the eastward extension of a TIW's cold cusp (Sections ref:sec:dcl and ref:sec:dyn).
This shear results from the rotation or tilting of horizontal vorticity generated by horizontal vortex stretching at the equator (Section ref:sec:dyn).
Indirect observational evidence for this TIW-forced off-equatorial deep cycle is presented through $\Ri$ profiles from three cruise sections through TIWs at 110° W (Section ref:sec:obs).
Our results emphasize the need to observe turbulence variability off the equator, both to validate these results and to assess the accuracy of turbulence parameterization schemes in simulating deep-cycle turbulence modulated by TIWs.

- cold tongue SST and heat uptake important to climate (CITATION)
    - "half of the seasonal cycle in the peak vertical mixing heat flux is associated with shear instability in the tropical Pacific cold tongue, highlighting this region’s global importance"
    - "diabatic mixing processes must transport ~1.6 PW of heat across the 21.5°C isotherm."
    - Ryan: Also, even without referring to the seasonal cycle you can highlight that a large fraction of the heat that enters the ocean enters in the eastern Pacific cold tongue (e.g. Fig. 1a of Holmes et al. 2019, I think there is some numbers in there somewhere too). This heat uptake is enabled largely by mixing which keeps the surface cool. Furthermore - this gives you further motivation for the off-equatorial mixing. The TIWs and the presence of strong mixing away from the Equator expands the area of cold ocean surface available to take up heat.
    - In the global budget, shear mixing in eq. Pacific is responsible for the largest fluxes (annual average > 150W/m²)

* Methods
** Model configuration
<<sec:model>>

We use a regional configuration of the MITgcm citep:Marshall1997,Adcroft2004 to model the equatorial Pacific cold tongue.
The domain extends from 170°W to 95°W, 12°S to 12°N with a horizontal grid spacing of 1/20°.
There are 345 vertical levels with a spacing of 1m in the top 250m that increases to a maximum of 250m.
The model is forced at the surface with fields from the JRA-55do reanalysis citep:jra55 and lateral boundary conditions are specified using daily averaged fields from the Mercator GLORYS12V1 1/12° ocean reanalysis product (Copernicus identifier @@latex:\texttt{GLOBAL\_REANALYSIS\_PHY\_001\_030}@@).
The simulated time period is from 01 Sep 1995 to 28 Feb 1997.
There is no tidal forcing.
The time axis, when presented in figures, is "local time" at 110°W chosen to be UTC-7.

#+latex: {\alert
Sub-grid scale vertical mixing is parameterized using the K Profile Parametrization (KPP) scheme of cite:Large1994 with standard parameter values citep:Large1999.
The KPP turbulence scheme divides the water column into three parts: an interior region, a boundary layer, and a surface layer (defined to be the top 10% of the boundary layer near the surface).
The KPP boundary layer depth $\hkpp$ is usually chosen as the depth at which the /bulk/ Richardson number
\begin{equation}
Ri_b = \frac{Δb H_{0.3}}{\abs{ΔV}² + V^2_t(H_{0.3})}
\end{equation}
exceeds a critical value chosen to be 0.3 ($H_{0.3}$).
Here $Δb$ and $ΔV$ are the differences between values of resolved buoyancy $b$ and resolved velocity $V$ at the surface and at the base of the boundary layer $z=H_{0.3}$.
$V_t$ represents a parameterized velocity due to unresolved turbulent eddies.
In addition, $\hkpp$ is restricted to be less that the Monin-Obukhov length scale
\begin{equation}
L_{MO} = \frac{-u³_*}{κ \, B_0}
\end{equation}
so that
\begin{equation}
\hkpp = \min\left[ {L_{MO}, H_{0.3}}\right]
\end{equation}
Here $u_*$ is a friction velocity at the ocean surface, $B_0$ is the surface buoyancy flux, and $κ=0.4$ is the von Karman constant.
Below $\hkpp$, diffusivity due to shear mixing is parameterized as a smooth function of gradient Richardson number $\Ri$ that is non-zero for $Ri < 0.7$.
The shear mixing scheme's parameters were specifically tuned to reproduce the onset of nighttime convection relative to LES citep:Large1999.

The model fields are compared with the cite:Johnson2002 climatology and a decadal (1990-2000) average of the TAO mooring data (the TAO data only cover the winter of 1996, so we use the decadal average instead).
The EUC maximum is approximately 15-20m deeper than the TAO data and the cite:Johnson2002 climatology (Figure [[fig:validation]]b), though the depth-integrated zonal velocity in the top 250m is comparable to that from the Johnson climatology (Figure [[fig:validation]]c).

** Diagnostics
The Richardson number $\Ri=N²/S²$ with $N²=-gρ_z/ρ_0$, $S²=u_z^2 + v_z^2$, $ρ_0=\SI{1025}{\kg\per\m\cubed}$.
All derivatives are estimated using centered differences.
$\Ri$ is set to NaN when $N² < \SI{1e-6}{\per\square\second}$ or $S² < \SI{1e-6}{\per\square\second}$.
The mixed layer depth $\zmld$ is computed as the shallowest depth at which the density exceeds the surface density by $\SI{0.015}{\kg\per\m\cubed}$.
# and $N² > \SI{1e-6}{\per\sec\square}$.
The base of the deep cycle layer $\zri$ is computed as the shallowest depth below the mixed layer base when $\Ri$ exceeds 0.5.
Our choice of 0.5 instead of 0.25 is discussed later in Section [[sec:dcl]]
The width of the low Richardson number layer or "low $\Ri$ layer" is defined as $H = \zmld - \zri$.
Parameterized turbulent heat flux $J_q^t = -ρ_0 c_p K_T T_z$ where $c_p$ is the specific heat capacity of water; negative values indicate heat moving downward.

** TIW modulated turbulence in the cold tongue
<<sec:dcl>>

TIW variability imprints itself strongly on SST and subsurface turbulent mixing both on and off the equator (Figure ref:fig:snapshot).
# Energetic TIW variability is visible between approximately 5°S and 5°N in net surface heat flux $\Qnet$, SST, zonal velocity $u$, integrated turbulent heat flux in the low $\Ri$ layer and width of the low $\Ri$ layer (Figure ref:fig:snapshot, top to bottom).
The cold tongue is a region of heat uptake (positive $\Qnet$ in Figure [[fig:snapshot]]a) complemented by intense vertical mixing in the cold cusps of TIWs (Figure [[fig:snapshot]]d).
The heat entering the ocean at the surface is being moved deeper into the water column by turbulence in the TIW cold cusp (Figure [[fig:snapshot]]d).
The low $\Ri$ layer also extends off the equator and its patterns match those in SST suggesting both TIW influence and the existence of intense vertical mixing (Figure [[fig:snapshot]]e).
In the east, the EUC is concentrated in an approximately 1° wide latitudinal band around the equator (Figure [[fig:snapshot]]c).
The off-equatorial low $\Ri$ flow (Figure [[fig:snapshot]]e) and associated mixing (Figure [[fig:snapshot]]d) is not directly associated with the EUC.

The vertical structure of mixing associated with this particular TIW at 110°W shows a deep cycle of mixing both on and off the equator at 3.5°N (Figure [[fig:dcl035]]c,e).
# Panels (a, b) are latitude-time plots of SST and $J_q^t$ averaged in the low $\Ri$ layer; again note that these have similar patterns as in Figure [[fig:snapshot]].
# Panels (c, e) highlight daily cycles in $J_q^t$ at 0°N and at 3.5°N, the latter being the approximate latitude of the eastward extension of the cold cusp.
At both latitudes, there is a daily cycle in turbulence beneath the mixed layer base ($\zmld$; orange) and above the base of the low $\Ri$ layer ($\zri$, black).
At the equator, $\zri$ shallows during the warm phase as observed and described by cite:Inoue2012,Inoue2019 and cite:Moum2009b.
At 3.5°N, the deep cycles start when the cold cusp reaches that latitude, and persists over the time period during which the TIW cold cusp extends poleward of this latitude (approximately twelve days).
There is almost no turbulence beneath the mixed layer prior to the arrival of the cold cusp and after its departure.
Daily cycles are also visible in $\Ri$, $S²$, $N²$ at 3.5°N beneath the mixed layer base for the time period when the deep cycle is active (Figure ref:fig:dcl35).
Such daily cycles in shear, stratification and $\Ri$ are qualitatively similar to observations and LES at 0°N, 140°W citep:Moum2009b,Pham2017.
We defer a more detailed discussion of the daily cycle to Section [[sec:daily]].

$\Ri$ in observed deep cycle layers has a median value of 0.25 citep:Smyth2013,Pham2017.
$\Ri$ in the /simulated/ deep cycle layer has a median value of 0.4, a notable bias (Figure [[fig:dcl035]]d,f), suggesting that the KPP mixing scheme is too diffusive.
This may be partly responsible for the subsurface warm bias in Figure [[fig:validation]]e.
# The distribution of $\Ri$ at depths between $\zmld$ and $\zri$ for the time period marked by the solid red line (panels d,f) show relatively low Richardson numbers $\Ri ≲ 0.4$ (median in solid line, shading indicates interquartile range).
The $\Ri$ bias may partly arise because KPP's shear mixing scheme parameterizes diffusivity $K_T$ as a smooth function of $\Ri$ that is non-zero for $Ri < 0.7$ citep:Large1994.
Diffusivities are enhanced for relatively large $\Ri$ values, when compared to the enhancement observed for $\Ri≈0.25$ in observations (for example, citealp:Zaron2009,Peters1988), thereby making it impossible to represent a state of marginal stability at $\Ri ≈ 0.25$ citep:Holmes2015.
We also find that approximately a quarter of the parameterized turbulent heat flux in the deep cycle layer is handled by KPP's surface layer mixing scheme (discussed later in Section [[sec:daily]]).
Hence deficiencies in KPP's shear mixing scheme may not be the sole reason for the bias in $\Ri$.
Here we account for the bias in $\Ri$ by treating simulated flows with $\Ri\approx 0.4$ as being marginally stable.
#+latex: }

# The \(\Ri\)-based shear-mixing model only crudely reflects the dynamics that are thought to underpin observations of marginal stability, e.g. hydrodynamic stability theory citep:Miles1961,Howard1961 and the energetics of stratified turbulence in the laboratory or direct numerical simulations (e.g., citealp:Rohr1988,Holt1992); and may overestimate heat fluxes in the marginally stable layer citep:Zaron2009.
# The model nominally achieves marginally stable equilibrium at a range of $\Ri$ smaller than 0.7 (approximately 0.4 in Figure [[fig:dcl035]]d,f).
# The precise $\Ri$ at equilibrium likely depends on the large scale forcing as well as the model parameters (e.g. citealp:Holmes2015).

Though this manuscript focuses on one particular TIW, the correlation between low $\Ri$ flow off the equator and cold SSTs associated with TIWs is visible throughout the simulation at 110°W, 125°W, 140°W and 155°W. (Figure [[fig:Risim]]).
In particular low $\Ri$ values are more common north of the equator than south of the equator, and the latitudinal extent of low $\Ri$ flow widens toward the west.
These patterns match those of SST and are seen outside the latitudinal extent of the EUC (black lines in Figure [[fig:Risim]]).
Later during the season (Jan-Mar) TIW amplitudes weaken and clear cusps are not visible in SST.
Even then low $\Ri$ values are still visible off the equator where relatively cold SSTs are present (e.g. at 110°W in March; Figure [[fig:Risim]]a,b)
These patterns are qualitatively similar to those in Figure [[fig:snapshot]]d,e.
The rest of this manuscript focuses on one representative TIW highlighted by the black box in Figure [[fig:snapshot]]d.

** Dynamics of off-equatorial deep-cycle turbulence
<<sec:dyn>>

A deep cycle of turbulence can only exist given a continuous source of shear that acts to reduce $\Ri$ and a diurnal trigger that initiates turbulence, which may then increase $\Ri$ citep:Smyth2019.
Together the shear forcing and turbulence act to maintain the deep-cycle layer in a state of marginal stability.
At 0°, 140°W equatorial winds maintain intense zonal shear $u_z$ between the SEC and the EUC and the diurnal trigger may be the nighttime instability of the surface-trapped diurnal warm-layer jet citep:Pham2017 or the breaking of downward propagating internal waves triggered by nighttime convection citep:Wijesekera1991.
In contrast, the simulated deep cycle at 3.5°N, 110°W is forced by meridional shear $v_z$ associated with the TIW flow (Section ref:sec:shear).
The simulated diurnal trigger is the daily descent of the surface mixing layer associated with the weakening of the stabilizing surface buoyancy flux in the afternoon (Section ref:sec:daily).

*** Marginal stability, shear and stratification in the cold cusp
<<sec:marginal>>

#+latex: {\alert
The off-equatorial low $\Ri$ layer is closely associated with the TIW's cold cusp (Figure [[fig:surface]]a,b, also Figure [[fig:snapshot]]b,d,e and Figure [[fig:Risim]]).
Nearly all of the cold cusp is marginally stable as illustrated by reduced shear $\shred = (u²_z + v_z^2) - N²/Ri_c$ (Figure [[fig:snapshot]]c).
Usually $Ri_c$ is chosen to be 0.25 since plane parallel flows are unstable to shear instability when $Ri < 0.25$ i.e. when $\shred > 0$ citep:Miles1961,Howard1961.
Empirically flow in the low $\Ri$ layer in our simulations has a median Richardson number of approximately 0.4 so we choose $\Ri_c = 0.4$ (see discussion in Section [[sec:dcl]] and Figure [[fig:dcl035]]; the following results are qualitatively insensitive to a range of values between 0.35 and 0.55).
Median $\shred$ in the low $\Ri$ layer ($\zri ≤ z ≤ \zmld$) is either close to 0 or positive in the cold cusp, so the flow there is marginally stable (Figure [[fig:snapshot]]c).
#+latex: }

# Behind the cold cusp, the vertical shear field is largely east-west oriented (top \SI{60}{m} average; Figure [[fig:shred]]c,d).
Between 1°S and 2°N and behind the cold cusp, the vertical shear of the flow is largely contributed by $u_z$ (Figure [[fig:surface]]d).
North of 2°N, the shear is largely contributed by $v_z$ (Figure [[fig:surface]]e).
Combining the shear fields (Figure [[fig:surface]]d,e) with the map of low $\Ri$ layer width and $\shred$ (Figure [[fig:surface]]b,c) suggests that $u_z$ drives the flow toward marginal instability south of 2°N while $v_z$ drives the flow toward marginal instability north of 2°N, in the eastward extension of the cold cusp.
Since $\shred$ is a linear combination of contributions from $N²$, $u_z^2$ and $v_z^2$; it allows a convenient assessment of the relative contributions of $u_z$ and $v_z$ toward marginal stability of the flow.

We split $\shred$ into two terms to evaluate whether $u_z$ or $v_z$ is individually large enough to overcome half the stratification necessary to drive the flow toward marginal stability,
#+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
\begin{equation}
\shred = \left[ u_z² – \frac{N²}{2Ri_c} \right] + \left[v_z² – \frac{N²}{2Ri_c}\right].
\label{eq:shredsplit}
\end{equation}
#+END_EXPORT
# The factor of a half is arbitrary but useful in comparing the magnitudes of $u_z²$ and $v_z²$ to $N²$ without dividing by small numbers.
Snapshots of heat flux $J_q$, reduced shear $u_z² + v_z² - N²/Ri_c$ and the two terms on the RHS of \eqref{eq:shredsplit} computed using $\Ri_c = 0.4$ are shown in Figure [[fig:shred]]a--l at three different times indicated by vertical dashed lines in Figure [[fig:surface]].
Enhanced turbulence is present in the low $\Ri$ layer between $\zmld$ (orange) and $\zri$ (black).
The regions of enhanced turbulence coincide with positive values of reduced shear.
Zonal shear $u_z$ is responsible for shear turbulence both at the equator (Figure [[fig:shred]]c,g,k) and in the northward-oriented cold cusp between 0 and 3°N (Figure [[fig:shred]]f,g).
The corresponding $v_z$ is weak (Figure [[fig:shred]]h,i).
This pattern reverses in the eastward extension of the cold cusp: $v_z$ is strong but $u_z$ is weak between 2°N and 4°N (Figure [[fig:shred]]k,l).
These three cross-sections confirm that $u_z$ acts to force turbulence in the near-equatorial region (1°S --2°N) while $v_z$ forces the off-equatorial deep cycle turbulence, as inferred from Figure [[fig:surface]]c,d,e.

#+latex:{ \alert
Finally, mean $N²$ in the cold cusp changes by a approximately a factor of two between the equator and in the eastward extension of the cold cusp (Figure [[fig:surface]]f, Figure [[fig:N2]]a).
This decrease is a result of intense mixing seen in the cold cusp.
We can illustrate this by considering the evolution equation for $N²$
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:N2}
D_t N² = D_t b_z = \underbrace{- u_z b_x -v_z b_y}_\textit{TILT} \; \underbrace{-w_z b_z}_\textit{STRETCH} + \underbrace{∂_{zz} K_T b_z}_\textit{MIX}
\end{equation}
where $D_t = ∂_t + ∂_x + ∂_y + ∂_z$ is the material derivative.
The terms on the RHS are integrated over the low $\Ri$ layer and presented in Figure [[fig:N2]]b--d.
The stretching and tilting terms act to increase stratification (\textit{STRETCH} + \textit{TILT}, Figure [[fig:N2]]c) while the mixing acts to decrease stratification (\textit{MIX}, Figure [[fig:N2]]d).
In total, these terms act to decrease stratification within most of the low $\Ri$ layer (Figure [[fig:N2]]b), consistent with the decrease in $N²$ seen in Figure [[fig:N2]]a.
So it is easier for the shear to force turbulence in the cold cusp off the equator as long as shear is generated in the cold cusp.
Next we examine the dynamics underlying this shear generation.

*** Shear forcing of off-equatorial deep cycle turbulence
<<sec:shear>>

The enhanced off-equatorial $v_z$ is a consequence of the rotation of the horizontal vorticity vector by the TIW's off-equatorial flow, illustrated in Figure ref:fig:horvort.
Streamlines (green) calculated using velocities relative to an approximate TIW westward translation speed of \SI{0.5}{\meter\per\second} show that water parcels follow a vortex-like circular path between 1°N and 4°N in the cold cusp.
The westward translation speed was determined from Hovmoeller plots of SST and 0-60m depth-averaged meridional velocity at latitudes between 0 and 4°N.
In all cases, \SI{0.5}{\meter\per\second} was judged to be a good approximation of the westward propagation speed.
Near-equatorial disturbances propagate faster than off-equatorial disturbances citep:Kennan2000 so the streamlines may be innacurate there.
# [fn::The streamlines are not closed because TIWs are leaky citep:Dutrieux2008].
Parcels pass through the near-equatorial region of high zonal shear, then move northward and eastward approximately parallel to the SST front (black contour; 23.8°C).
During this transit the horizontal vorticity vector $ω^x \hat{i} + ω^y \hat{j} = (w_y - v_z) \hat{i} + (u_z - w_x) \hat{j}$ (black) rotates from pointing southward to pointing westward.
This rotation illustrates that horizontal vortex tilting transforms $ω^y$ to $ω^x$ during the parcel's transit i.e. negative $u_z$ in the near-equatorial region is rotated to become positive $v_z$ off the equator.

The dynamics of this transformation can be illustrated using the evolution equation for the two shear components.
These equations are written so that the tilting term is decomposed into the tilting of the vertical and horizontal vorticity

Here $ζ = (f + v_x - u_y)$ is the total vertical vorticity, $b_x, b_y$ are baroclinic torque terms, $F^x_z, F^y_z$ are the frictional terms, and $D_t = ∂_t + ∂_x + ∂_y + ∂_z$ is the material derivative.
We present both components of vertical shear as well as the evolution terms in the RHS of \eqref{eq:shear} averaged over the top \SI{60}{m} in Figure ref:fig:shearev along with a contour marking a low $\Ri$ layer width of \SI{30}{m} for reference.
We focus on the magnitudes of the evolution terms within this 30m contour (where the advective terms are small, not shown).
# Figure ref:fig:shearev highlights the portion of the flow with low $\Ri$ layer widths larger than \SI{30}{m}.
# The baroclinic terms are weak and hence ignored.
TIW meridional diffluence (positive $v_y$) acts to stretch the horizontal vortex tube, $u_z v_y$ (Figure [[fig:shearev]]c), intensifying $u_z$ and forcing turbulence in the northward-oriented cold cusp between 0° and 3°N (Figure [[fig:shred]]e-h) as described by cite:Holmes2015.
North of approximately 2°N, the zonal shear weakens and meridional shear intensifies as the horizontal vorticity vector rotates from pointing southward to pointing westward i.e. negative $u_z$ is converted to positive $v_z$ (Figure ref:fig:horvort).
Accordingly, the horizontal vortex tilting terms for both $u_z$ and $v_z$ are relatively large in the northwest corner of the TIW (Figure [[fig:shearev]]g,h).
The sign of the horizontal vortex tilting terms within the \SI{30}{m} contour is such that the $u_z$ is decreased from a negative value to 0 while $v_z$ is increased from 0 to a positive value (Figure [[fig:shearev]]a,b).
Both tilting of vertical vorticity (Figure [[fig:shearev]]e,f) and the baroclinic torque (Figure [[fig:shearev]]i,j) are relatively weak within the 30m contour.
Enhanced turbulence within the \SI{30}{m} contour acts to decrease the magnitude of zonal and meridional shear (Figure [[fig:shearev]]k,l).
# $v_z$ is then decreased to 0 by frictional torque associated with turbulence.
The generation of $u_z$ in a near-equatorial region by horizontal vortex stretching citep:Holmes2015 and subsequent rotation of $u_z$ to $v_z$, or $ω^y$ to $ω^x$, by the anticyclonic TIW flow $u_y$ (Figure [[fig:shearev]]g,h) is the continuous shear forcing that forces off-equatorial turbulence.
# This shear is then reduced by the deep cycle turbulence.

*** Simulated trigger of deep cycle turbulence
<<sec:daily>>

As at the equator, turbulence in the low $\Ri$ layer must be triggered daily for a diurnal cycle to exist.
How does the KPP scheme model that daily trigger off the equator?

#+latex:{\alert
During times of TIW influence, our simulations show some diurnal variation in $H_{0.3}$, the shallowest depth at which $Ri_b=0.3$ (Section [[sec:model]]), off the equator (Figure ref:fig:kppdcl).
However the base of the KPP boundary layer $\hkpp$ is significantly shallower than $H_{0.3}$ during daytime (black line is shallower than thick red line).
Daytime values of $\hkpp$ are limited to the Monin Obukhov scale $L_{MO}$ (Section [[sec:model]]) which is approximately 2.5-5m i.e. one to two grid cells deep.
After peak sun in the afternoon, $L_{MO}$ deepens to approximately \SIrange{50}{60}{m} and so does $\hkpp$ (Figure [[fig:kppdcl]]b-e).
Coincidentally, $L_{MO}$ and $H_{0.3}$ are approximately equal on Dec 3 at 7pm local time (53m vs 56m).
The next day $L_{MO} = \SI{53}{m}$ is deeper than $H_{0.3} = \SI{46}{m}$ at 7pm local time, so $\hkpp = H_{0.3}$.
After 7pm, the surface heat flux turns destabilizing, so $L_{MO}$ is undefined and $\hkpp$ matches $H_{0.3}$ during the night.
In this way, the descent of the daytime shear layer in the late afternoon citep:Smyth2013b is entirely modelled by the change in surface fluxes (as reflected in $L_{MO}$) rather than a dynamical instability resulting from increased interior shear relative to the stratification (as reflected in $H_{0.3}$).

Note that $\hkpp = L_{MO} > \zmld$ for approximately an hour (6pm-7pm) before the onset of convection (vertical white dashed lines).
Diffusivities are enhanced within the boundary layer i.e. within the stratified water beneath the mixed layer resulting in large heat fluxes just prior to the onset of nighttime convection.
The descent of the boundary layer results in strong parameterized turbulence heat fluxes below the mixed layer where the vertical stratification combines with high boundary layer diffusivities (Figure [[fig:kppdcl]]e).
Parameterized mixing is also excited in the low $\Ri$ layer below $\hkpp$, likely triggered by the matching of surface layer and shear mixing diffusivities at $\hkpp$ citep:Large1994.
Subsequently, $\Ri$ increases during the night which in turn reduces $J_q^t$ (Figure [[fig:kppdcl]]b,e).
When the sun rises, $L_{MO}$ is now well-defined and shoals to its daytime value of approximately \SI{5}{m}.
Since $L_{MO} < H_{0.3}$,  $\hkpp$ is set to $L_{MO}$ during the day.
Daytime $\Ri$ values in the low $\Ri$ layer are in the 0.4-0.5 range, so the parameterized shear turbulence is never completely extinguished (KPP enhances diffusivities for $\Ri < 0.7$).
The daily cycle then repeats (Figure ref:fig:dcl35).

Over the entire TIW, roughly one third of the total off-equatorial parameterized heat flux between 3°N and 5°N occurs within the KPP surface boundary layer (Figure [[fig:fluxkpp]]a).
Near the equator, this fraction is quite small i.e. the equatorial deep cycle is almost completely modelled by KPP's interior shear mixing scheme.
The difference between the modeled equatorial and off-equatorial deep cycles is likely due to the difference in $N²$ (Figure [[fig:fluxkpp]]b).
Off the equator, $N²$ is smaller than at the equator by a factor of two to three, so $H_{0.3}$ can penetrate deeper in the water column compared to at the equator (Figure [[fig:fluxkpp]]c).
So a larger fraction of the low $\Ri$ layer off the equator is handled by the surface boundary layer scheme.
Though the difference between $H_{KPP}$ and $z_{MLD}$ off the equator is small on average (Figure [[fig:fluxkpp]]c), the large diffusivities of the surface boundary layer scheme combine with small but non-zero stratification to yield large heat fluxes (e.g. Figure [[fig:kppdcl]]e).
This difference in equatorial and off-equatorial $N²$ also means that the $L_{MO}$ limiter is more consequential off the equator than at the equator thereby explaining why cite:Large1999 did not see any sensitivity to the $L_{MO}$ limiter (though note that their presented calculations did not represent TIW influence; their Section 3d).

** Indirect observational evidence
<<sec:obs>>

To our knowledge there is no reported observational evidence for an off-equatorial deep cycle of turbulence associated with TIWs.
# In the absence of direct microstructure measurements clearly showing a daily cycle in turbulence beneath the mixed layer as has been observed repeatedly at the equator (for e.g. citealp:Gregg1985).
In the absence of direct microstructure measurements, one might look at /in-situ/ $\Ri$ estimates since marginal stability is detectable using coarse measurements of shear and stratification at least at the equator citep:Smyth2013,Pham2017.
The absence of ADCPs on the off-equatorial TAO moorings prevents replicating the analysis of cite:Smyth2013 or cite:Pham2017.
Instead we will use coincident measurements of velocity from shipboard ADCPs and density from CTD casts obtained during cruises that sampled a TIW by chance.

$\Ri$ estimated using high resolution velocity and stratification measurements indicate that deep cycle turbulence is associated with a $\Ri$ distribution with statistical mode 0.25 (2-m velocity bins; citealp:Smyth2013).
The mode remains at 0.25 even when the velocity measurements are significantly degraded to 16-m bins.
The cite:Smyth2013 observations are limited in that they were taken at a single location (0°N, 140°W) for a short period of time (two weeks) during a period of strong TIW forcing.
Guided by their observations, we assume that deep cycle turbulence everywhere is characterized by a $\Ri$ distribution with statistical mode 0.25, and that $\Ri$ in the deep cycle layer can be estimated from relatively coarse observations.
Since the mode is 0.25, we expect the most likely observed $\Ri$ value to be 0.25 in a deep cycle layer.

We infer low values of $Ri$, less than 1, below the mixed layer both at the equator (as expected) as well as off the equator at 4°N and 5°N in profiles from three sections at 110°W through TIWs (Table [[tab:cruise]]; Figure ref:fig:ctdadcp).
Cruise CTD and ADCP data were obtained from the CLIVAR and Carbon Hydrographic Data Office (CCHDO) and the Joint Archive for Shipboard ADCP (JASADCP) respectively.
We estimate $\Ri$ by first averaging the \SI{1}{m} binned CTD data in the bins used for the ADCP data (either \SI{8}{m} or \SI{10}{m} bins), and then estimating $N²$ and $S²$ using centered differences.
Bins where $N² < \SI{1e-6}{\per\s\squared}$ and $S² < \SI{1e-6}{\per\square\second}$ are excluded.
These $\Ri$ profiles are presented in Figure [[fig:ctdadcp]]b,c;e,f;h,i along with a higher-resolution $N²$ profile estimated using \SI{3}{\m} averaged CTD profiles.
In general, $Ri < 1$ off the equator with values close to 0.25 in three to five successive bins below the mixed layer (where $N² ≈ \SIrange{1e-5}{1e-4}{\per\second\squared}$).
As in the model, $v_z$ is the dominant shear term (not shown).
The data in Figure ref:fig:ctdadcp are noisy but suggest that further examination of such sections might be useful given the lack of moored ADCPs and microstructure data.
A more thorough analysis would use all sections at 110°W, 125°W and 140°W to estimate a median $\Ri$ profile through the TIW cold cusp.
This work is ongoing.

* Summary

The primary result here is that the simulated TIWs force a deep cycle of turbulence off the equator throughout the cold tongue (Figures ref:fig:snapshot, ref:fig:dcl035, ref:fig:dcl35, ref:fig:Risim, ref:fig:kppdcl).
Horizontal vortex stretching by meridional diffluence $v_y$ of the TIW's flow intensifies pre-existing $u_z$ within approximately 2° north of the equator (Figure [[fig:shearev]]c; citealp:Holmes2015).
The TIW's anticyclonic flow then rotates these horizontal vortex tube anticyclonically, converting $u_z$ to $v_z$ in the eastward extension of the cold cusp (Figures ref:fig:horvort and [[fig:shearev]]g,h).
This continuous stretching and tilting of horizontal vorticity acts to create a region of intense shear and low $\Ri$ below the mixed layer in the TIW cold cusp (Figure ref:fig:surface).
The flow regime in the TIW cold cusp is similar to the equatorial flow regime where intense shear between the SEC and EUC exists below the mixed layer (Figure ref:fig:shred).
There is a daily cycle of turbulence in the off-equatorial low $\Ri$ layer that is associated with a downward descending shear layer in the afternoon (Figure ref:fig:dcl35).

The KPP mixing scheme models the descending shear and mixing off the equator by specifying high diffusivities in a boundary layer whose vertical scale is limited to Monin-Obukhov scale $L_{MO}$ during daytime (Figure ref:fig:kppdcl, Section ref:sec:daily).
#+latex:{\alert
In the afternoon, $L_{MO}$ increases as the surface buoyancy flux weakens.
The increase in $L_{MO}$ leads to the late-afternoon descent of a high diffusivity boundary layer with high shear at its base.
The deepening boundary layer results in mixing in the low $\Ri$ layer beneath the MLD leading to daily cycles of parameterized turbulence, $\Ri, S²$ and $N²$ in the low $\Ri$ layer (Figures ref:fig:dcl35 and ref:fig:kppdcl; Section ref:sec:daily).
Approximately one quarter of the simulated off-equatorial turbulent heat flux is within KPP's surface boundary layer (Figure ref:fig:kppdcl).

The accuracy of KPP's simulation of these details of the off-equatorial deep cycle needs to be evaluated with LES simulations that account for the large-scale lateral TIW shear forcing (most LES simulations of deep cycle turbulence performed up to now do not account for lateral momentum and buoyancy flux forcing terms).
Observational evidence for an off-equatorial deep cycle is nonexistent with the exception of the small number of $\Ri$ profiles within a TIW cold cusp (Figure ref:fig:ctdadcp).
There is a need for high resolution observations to validate the current MITgcm and future LES simulations.
#+latex:}

# It is plausible though perhaps unlikely that the current simulation with the KPP parameterization accurately captures all the details of the off-equatorial deep cycle.
# particularly the diurnal deepening of the mixing layer.

The deep cycle transports heat absorbed by the near-surface ocean during daytime to depths deeper than the base of the convective mixed layer; keeping it away from reabsorption by the atmosphere during convection the following night.
In doing so, the deep cycle helps keep the sea surface cool, enabling significant heat uptake by the eastern equatorial Pacific cold tongue.
Our simulations indicate that this effective subduction of heat is taking place over an area larger than what might be expected from shear turbulence associated with SEC-EUC shear i.e. poleward of the 3°S-3°N region.
# Shear mixing in the cold tongue is an important influence on the Earth's climate with possible links to ENSO citep:Warner2019,
Yet direct microstructure measurements have mostly been made at the equator.
Our results, and the associated uncertainties, emphasize the need to constrain the magnitude, the dynamics, and the long term impact of off-equatorial turbulence in the eastern Pacific cold tongue.

# The prevailing explanation for the diurnal trigger of deep cycle turbulence is the instability of the diurnal warm layer jet once solar forcing weakens in the evening citep:Pham2017.
# This explanation is quite general and diurnal warm layers are present over large regions of the eastern equatorial Pacific (for example citealp:Clayson2013).
# Therefore a working hypothesis is that the same instability forces the diurnal cycle both on and off the equator.

Deep cycle and the ECT heat budget
  - Deep cycle mixing extracts heat from mixed layer; redistributes it in a layer between ML base and DCL base.
  - Monthly mean advection in this layer moves the heat poleward cite:Ray2018
  - Does the vertical profile of monthly mean $v$ matter? Does the depth of deep cycle mixing enable more export?
  - How would this look in temperature coordinates?
  - TIWs stir cold ECT water poleward, where it absorbs heat from the atmosphere, and stir warm off-equatorial water into the ECT, weakening the ECT via meridional advective warming (Jochum et al. 2005; Menkes et al. 2006)

  - cite:Holmes2019 diffusive mixing peaks at equator, not much at 4-5°N. Also see Anna's stuff
  - deep cycle helps keep the cold cusp cold → SST-wind feedback citep:Chelton2001.

 - In the high-resolution OGCM, however, TIWs did not cool the warm waters north of the equator to heat the ECT. Instead, they increased the atmosphere–ocean heat flux near the equator. Thus, TIWs act as a vertical heat pump, rather than a horizontal mixer of temperature. The focus of Jochum et al. (2005) was the large-scale SST, not the detailed processes by which TIWs change the SST.

  - What isothermal layers is the deep cycle pumping heat into?
  - how important is diathermal heat transport at 3N relative to that at equator?
    - is it more efficient at pumping heat to the "right" isothermal class?
  - ITCZ?
    - need studies relating SST anomalies in ITCZ region
    - expansion of the cold water area allows more heat uptake?
** is there a similar signal in the equatorial atlantic? :noexport:
 - common features between eq. atl & eq Pac
   - seems to be marginal stability + TIWs + (deep?) daily cycles
   - daily cycles: cite:Wenegrat2015,Foltz2020,Perez2019
   - these papers have hourly high-res shear so possibly a nice place to look  (if they havent published that already)
