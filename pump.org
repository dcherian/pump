** Marginal instability

1. In marginally unstable systems, Ri tends to cluster around 1/4 citep:Smyth2019 : this is /scale invariance/ --- This is why the usual averaging bias in Ri estimates is not a problem at the equator citep:Pham2017. This behaviour is seen for stratified turbulence forced by a mean shear that varies slowly on the time scale of the instabilities.

2. cite:Smyth2013a grid T, ADCP on 5m grid and then differentiate. Use N2 = g α T_z.

** TIWs
- Meridional velocity seems to be a good way to define phases.

Inoue papers:
- N-S phase has strongest mixing
- S phase -> UCL (-300 W/m^2; 1e-3 m^2/s)
  - EQUIX was the first expt where microstructure measurements were taken during the S phase
  - Can models recover this?
- Turbulence appears to be proportional to Sh^2_{red}
- S-N, N phases have weakest mixing / heat flux + strongest dT/dz
- S^2 , N^2 co-vary (Inoue et al, 2012; Figure 8)

Ryan:
- Zonal shear is the main thing. Meridional shear is not so important.

** Todo
- [X] Barotropic flow and slope of EUC

- [ ] Diurnal cycle

- [X] meridional profile of the EUC. How wide is it? What depth is the maximum width? This can be compared with the Johnson et al data at different longitudes.

- [ ] Meridional shear and location/strength of NECC

- [X] shear above the EUC. Are the two lobes of the westward SEC above it realistic? (Again Johnson, also the long equatorial mooring time series at 110W, 140W, 170W, 165E). The site with these is shut down now but will presumably be up again soon.

- [ ] Variability of TIWs (amplitude, lateral extent, frequency)

- [ ] the TIWs you mention will be a good test, since Frank has shown that his 0.1-degree run has much stronger TIWs than the 1-degree run. Do they get even stronger at 1/20th? Does the cold tongue front sharpen? Beyond the present project, we need to understand the role of model resolution on TIWs, since they are so fundamental to the upper heat budget. There is limited data to test this (a few short-term experiments), except SST may be useful.

- [ ] temporal variation of U, V, shear, stratification within TIW cycle in mixed layer, pycnocline, EUC core, and below at 110, 125, and 140W. Especially, compare  with observations that we have found in 2008.

** Summary

1. EUC is narrower and weaker than Johnson climatology. EUC maximum is slightly deeper (20m or so).
2.

*** Marginal (in)stability

#+CAPTION: Seasonal median Ri profiles like cite:Smyth2013a for TAO locations along the equator. This uses daily average output.
[[file:images/seasonal-Ri-tao.png]]

#+CAPTION: Compare gcm runs to TAO at (0, 140). Still biased high. The TAO estimates are with daily-averaged output.
[[file:images/Ri-all-models.png]]

*** Deep cycle

Definitions:
1. Depth of max squared shear
2. dε/dt : since DCL is a daily cycle in ε. Average εto 6h intervals and then compute dε/dt. Identify penetration of daily varying epsilon + choose greatest depth of penetration

**** Zaron & Moum

KPP defines /mixing layer/ as Ri < 0.3 which would include the deep cycle layer?

But Zaron & Moum show SBL (i.e. mixing layer depth) as being different from MLD and deep cycle?

Large & Gent: Pacanowski & Philander scheme has much higher diffusivities because they need that to get a surface mixed layer but KPP has a surface layer mixing scheme to take care of that.

**** Are the models simulating a deep cycle?
 a. 1m:

 b. 10m: Hmmm..
  #+CAPTION: Not sure if the 10m simulation actually has a deep cycle. The descending shear max  corresponds to base of the mixed layer. (c) DCL $K_T$ mean, median (d,e) Solid lines are MLD, DCL base, EUC max.

* Diary

** <2019-06-10 Mon>

- No luck so far with a new DCL base definition
- There seems to be large variation for each TIW "period" though composites at 110W, 125W, 140W are consistent

** <2019-05-14 Tue>

- Looking for deep cycle signal. I may or may not see it. Hard to be sure.

- Simulation domain begins at 95W. Do we move this further east to avoid edge effects?

*** Comments
- [ ] Do vertical profile of transport instead of mean velocity.
